{"tagline":"A collection of scripts to run a twitter doorbell on a Raspberry Pi","google":"UA-37429820-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Toctoc","body":"Ceci est une sonnette? Is that french? Oui, monsieur! That means \"This is a doorbell\" and if it feels like a *Déjà vu* to you, you may have seen Magritte's famous painting [The Treachery of Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceci_n%27est_pas_une_pipe)\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a working doorbell, using Twitter as a wire between the push-button and the bell. This is made possible with the help of a very small and pretty cheap computer: the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org). We used two Raspberry's here, one at each end of the wire: one does the knock and one does the ring.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will cover everything to do that! We'll go through \r\n\r\n* writing the python scripts to tweet and monitor tweets using the Twitter API\r\n* writing a log file with Python\r\n* wrapping those scripts into daemons. Daemons are services that run in the background of your operating system. \r\n* build a ssh tunnel to monitor your raspberry when you're out of home, *without* doing some boring configuration in your router's interface to enable port forwarding\r\n\r\n# What You'll Need\r\n\r\n* 2 Raspberry Pi Model B\r\n* 1 push-button (I found mine in an old doorbell system but you can use any simple push-button)\r\n* 1 MTA connector and some wires\r\n* 2 speakers (like some cheap usb powered speakers with a mini-jack)\r\n* 2 ethernet cables to connect your raspberry pi's to your local network\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n## Get Raspbian on a SD card\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi has an SD card reader in place of a hard drive you'll find on a normal computer. However it works the same, your Raspberry Pi will lauch the Operating System on your SD card.\r\nThe Raspberry Pi Foundation has made available a version linux for the Raspberry Pi, it's a derivate of debian and is called Raspbian.\r\nIf you don't have a preloaded SD card with Raspbian, you need to download and write your SD card. The Raspberry Pi has written a [guide for beginners](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup) that has instructions to write the SD card from Windows, OS X or Linux.\r\n\r\n## Are you confortable with a terminal? ssh? vim? git?\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we will always connect to the raspberry's remotely using [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)\r\n\r\nOur favourite text editor is vim. If you don't know vim yet, follow vim's own quick interactive tutorial by typing *vimtutor* in your terminal. But you're free to use emacs or nano. \r\n\r\nIt's not mandatory to use git in this tutorial, but if you want to learn, follow the steps in [tryGit](http://try.github.com)\r\n\r\n## Give it a try\r\n\r\nConnect you Raspberry Pi to the network, and access it remotely via ssh. By default, the hostname is 'raspberrypi' and user/password is pi/raspberry\r\n```\r\n$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Monitor a hashtag with the Twitter API"}
